##IMPORTANT NOTE
This is not yet in a state usable by anyone other than developers

### What is this?
This is a client for the online BR [surviv.io](https://surviv.io).  


### Is this a hack?
No*, and it will never be

*It gives **small** advantages, such as more screen space and could facilitate hacks, but no more than the current browser version  

### Organisation & Philosophy
Simplicity/elegance > robustness/optimisation except for one time long waits (eg. deobfuscation/getting stats)  
Try not to add to requirements.txt, but if you have to, then do.
100% test coverage is a goal

### I want to contribute/look around, where to start?
Go to docs/meta/START_HERE.md  
Anything as small as a typo fix is welcomed
