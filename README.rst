Surviv.py
=========

IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------
This is not yet in a state usable by anyone other than developers

What is this?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a client (and netcode) for the online BR `surviv.io <https://surviv.io>`_.

Is this a hack?
"""""""""""""""
No*, and it will never be

It gives *small* advantages, such as more screen space and could facilitate hacks, but is not itself a hack

Organisation & Philosophy
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Simplicity/elegance > robustness/optimisation except for one time long waits (eg. deobfuscation/getting stats), cases which could create a security risk (deobfuscation) and places that really need it.
Try not to add to requirements.txt, but if you have to, then do.
100% test coverage is a goal

I want to contribute/look around, where to start?
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Docs can be built using sphinx or you can go to `readthedocs <https://survivpy.readthedocs.io/>`_.
Feel free to make an issue.
